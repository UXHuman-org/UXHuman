<!-- UXHuman Manifesto v0.1 – 05-05-2025 -->
# UXHuman: **Liberating Digital Experiences to Finally Understand Humans**

*A manifesto for product owners, designers, and engineers — to create interfaces governed by natural language, **layered over the systems you already run**, where users communicate their own intent.*

---

We once had a brilliant friend who **couldn’t understand language**.  
To communicate, we created picture-card decks — one for work, one for travel, one for shopping, and many more for every other corner of life.  
**All day we shuffled between these decks,** flashing symbols and hoping the meaning landed. We became so fluent we forgot how absurd — and exhausting — the ritual was.

Then our friend learned language overnight.  
Suddenly we could simply **say** what we meant, with tone, nuance, even jokes — no cards, no guessing. The conversation felt effortless **and profoundly more human;** we connected in ways the cards never allowed.

**Our everyday apps — booking tools, payroll portals, CRMs, and countless other websites — are that friend.** Buttons, menus, and form fields are our picture cards. We still juggle deck after deck, paying a needless cognitive tax — even though computers now understand natural language.

**UXHuman draws the line:** the picture-card era ends here. We will liberate digital experiences so they **understand first**, deepen empathy, and let every user communicate intent in their own words — throughout the entire journey. **Rich visual and interactive elements will still thrive — but they’ll be _governed by natural language_, appearing only when they illuminate meaning.**

## Core Values

**L — Let language lead over imposed paths**  
Language is the most intuitive, lowest-friction way for users to express intent.

**T — Earn & keep user trust over quick wins**  
Honour the user’s intent first; trust compounds, tricks decay.

**M — Lighten the mental load over cosmetic polish**  
Fewer cognitive steps beat a pretty screen every time.

**A — User agency & openness over black-box decisions**  
People must see, understand, and control the data and logic that affect them.

## Guiding Principles

### 🗣️ L · Language
* **L-1** **Language First** — every task must be completable by speaking or typing; any UI shortcut is only a facilitator.  
* **L-2** **One Truth Everywhere** — chat and GUI share one live state; facts never conflict.  
* **L-3** **Speak / Type Parity** — voice, text, keyboard and screen-reader users can finish every flow.

### 🤝 T · Trust
* **T-1** **Instant Acknowledgment** — confirm every action in well under half a second; users should never wonder if the system heard them.  
* **T-2** **Don’t Ask Twice** — never request data the system already holds.  
* **T-3** **Help Before They Ask** — surface up to four context-aware suggestions that reflect the user’s current state and viable next steps.  
* **T-4** **One Thread, Whole Experience** — keep a single conversational thread across every touch-point so context and trust travel with the user.

### 🧠 M · Mental load
* **M-1** **Spotlight the Actionable** — keep choices and commitments visible at all times.  
* **M-2** **Separate Choice & Commitment** — visually distinguish possibilities from decisions.  
* **M-3** **Show Only What’s Next** — reveal deeper steps just-in-time.  
* **M-4** **No Dead Ends** — empty states explain why and offer a clear next step.  
* **M-5** **Simplicity = Fewer Steps** — ship only features that lower effort KPIs — or leave them out.

### 📖 A · Agency & openness
* **A-1** **Ask, Don’t Assume** — pose one clarifying question when information is missing or conflicting.  
* **A-2** **Human Fail-Safe** — when automation can’t resolve uncertainty, hand off to a human and inform the user.  
* **A-3** **Undo Is a Right** — every action should be undoable; warn before irreversible commitments.  
* **A-4** **Your Data, Your Call** — users can view, edit, or delete any personal data at any time.

## Beyond the User Experience — Toward **IntentWeb**

UXHuman sets the rules for human-first, language-governed interaction.  
When **every content, product, or service provider can resolve intent inside its own data boundaries — using the APIs and micro-services it already runs —** that intent stays sovereign and can travel intact, with no screen-scraping and no central gate-keepers guessing intent with someone else’s data.  
From that foundation emerges **IntentWeb**: a decentralised mesh where systems exchange intent as effortlessly as people do. **UXHuman is the first step; IntentWeb is the horizon.**

## Call to Action — _We’ve cut the chains; now let’s move._

- **Executives & companies** — champion one pilot that proves language-governed journeys slash effort and lift trust. Fund it, measure it, showcase it.  
- **Product owners** — rewrite your backlog as user sentences, then ship the smallest slice that lets someone succeed with words instead of clicks.  
- **Designers** — sketch the dialogue first, pixels second; make every prototype sing for voice, text, keyboard and screen-reader alike.  
- **Engineers** — map each intent to the APIs and micro-services you already operate; prove UXHuman without rebuilding your **backend**.  
- **Regulators & critics** — hold us to transparency, reversibility, and data sovereignty; the manifesto is only real when it passes your glare.  
- **Contributors & community** — fork the repo, propose new patterns, translate the manifesto, or open issues at **github.com/uxhuman/uxhuman**.

**The future of digital experience speaks human. Start building it today.**
