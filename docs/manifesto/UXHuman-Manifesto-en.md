# The UXHuman Manifesto

## The Broken Pact
Make no mistake: the old pact of the Internet is broken. The Web was meant to connect companies to their customers, yet today, AI giants stand in the middle.  
**Intent is the new currency of the Web.** But only AI giants accept it, shutting companies out of the Web’s economy.  
They scrape what companies build.  
They silence companies’ brands.  
They replace company voice with educated guesses, yet they are stuck at words, unable to act on intent.

**How did we get here?** For decades, digital systems couldn’t understand us. We built buttons, icons, and dashboards: the picture cards of the digital age. Humans paid the cognitive tax of decoding every new interface.  
But now, thanks to new AI, language is finally possible, giving birth to intent, the new currency of the Web. Humans are ready to spend it to break free from clicks and picture cards, but they are intercepted by AI giants, who keep the currency for themselves.

## The IntentWeb Declaration
**UXHuman draws the line.** The monopoly of today’s IntentKeepers, the AI giants, ends here. Intent must be mined for value by companies, not left in the control of AI giants.  
The era of clicks and picture cards is over. Stop building for clicks, start building for human intent. Users will communicate intent in their own words. Visuals and controls remain, but only to serve meaning, never to control.  
IntentKeepers must evolve into IntentGateways, routing intent faithfully to companies where it can truly be acted upon, rising from answer engines to orchestrators of execution.

## Toward the IntentWeb Architecture
The Web must now be rewritten around intent. Websites become IntentSites: sovereign places where intent becomes action. Natural language is the universal protocol — for humans and for machines. In this new architecture, every actor plays by the same values:

- **Humans — Free from Mental Load.** They express intent in their own words, without the cognitive tax of clicks and picture cards.
- **AI Agents — Enforce Trust.** They pursue human intent faithfully.
- **Companies — Be Sovereign.** They accept intent and act on it, choosing what to expose and what to protect, preserving ownership of execution and relationship.
- **AI Giants — Let Language Lead.** They must evolve from IntentKeepers into IntentGateways that orchestrate intent and execution.
- **Governments — Enable Sovereignty:** They bring excluded populations into the digital economy while ensuring national digital independence from foreign intermediaries.

## The Choice
There is no turning back. The choice is yours: stay in the past, polishing outdated interfaces, excluded from the Web economy, or be the first generation to give life to the IntentWeb, where the Web finally speaks Human.
