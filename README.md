# UXHuman – Open Framework for the IntentWeb

## **Overview**
**Make no mistake:** the old pact of the Internet is broken.  
The Web was meant to connect people and companies directly — yet today, **AI giants stand in the middle**, intercepting what truly matters: **Human Intent — the new currency of the Web.**

**UXHuman draws the line.**  
It defines the human, ethical, and interactional layer of the emerging **IntentWeb** — a distributed architecture where **intent, not attention, is the organizing principle.**  
The framework establishes a unified approach for systems that interpret and act on Human Intent expressed in natural language.  
It provides the conceptual, technical, and governance foundations that enable companies, institutions, and developers to participate directly in this new economy — without dependence on closed AI intermediaries.

> *“Stop building for clicks. Start building for Human Intent.”*

## **Background**
The attention-based model of the Web has reached its limit.  
As large AI platforms now mediate most digital interactions, organizations are being **silenced and displaced** — their voices replaced by algorithmic guesses.  

UXHuman proposes an open alternative: a standardized, interoperable way for any entity to **receive, interpret, and fulfill Human Intent** through natural-language interfaces and machine-executable protocols.  
It restores the original spirit of the Web: a **direct bridge** between humans and organizations — this time rebuilt around **language, trust, and sovereignty.**

---

## **Framework Structure**
UXHuman consists of five interrelated canonical documents:

1. **Manifesto** — Defines the purpose, scope, and four foundational values: **Language, Trust, Mental Load, and Sovereignty.**  
   These values are expressed through nineteen design principles with measurable criteria.  

2. **Economic Model** — Describes how value flows in an intent-based ecosystem.  
   It differentiates between direct intent fulfillment and gateway-mediated orchestration, establishing the basis for sustainable attribution and revenue alignment.  

3. **Architecture Vision** — Specifies the core architectural constructs: Intent Manifests, Natural Language as Protocol, Incremental Resolution, Attribution Chains, Open Discovery, and Adaptive Presentation.  
   Together, they outline the foundational mechanisms of the **IntentWeb.**  

4. **Design Playbook** — Provides implementation patterns for applying the nineteen UXHuman principles in production environments, including reference patterns, anti-patterns, and measurable outcomes.  

5. **Governance & Collaboration Framework** — Defines contribution, certification, and maintenance processes.  
   Establishes working groups, RFC procedures, and review standards to ensure openness and accountability.

## **Relationship to the IntentWeb**
UXHuman operates as the **human and governance layer** of the IntentWeb.  
Implementations adhering to UXHuman principles — known as **IntentSites** — expose capabilities that can interpret and execute Human Intent through natural language.  
When these IntentSites interoperate through shared standards, they form the **IntentWeb** — an open network for intent resolution and execution.  

> *The Web must now be rewritten around intent — where language becomes protocol, and the Web finally speaks Human.*

## **Repository Contents**
- `/docs/` — Canonical documents defining the UXHuman framework  
- `/proof/` — Cryptographic proofs, version seals, and release attestations  
- `/LICENSE` — Applicable license information (CC BY 4.0 / CC BY-SA 4.0)  

Each release is versioned and timestamped for traceability and integrity verification.

## **Nature of This Repository**
UXHuman is a **canonical documentation framework**, not a software library.  
This repository contains the official specification documents that define the UXHuman model — its values, architecture, and governance.  

There is **no executable code** in this repository.  
Implementations of UXHuman principles (such as *IntentLayer* or *IntentSite* reference builds) are developed in separate projects within the IntentWeb ecosystem.  

Think of this repository as the **constitution of UXHuman** — the authoritative source of its philosophy, economic model, architecture, and certification rules.

---

## **Versioning and Provenance**
All canonical documents are versioned under semantic tags (`v1.0`, `v1.1`, etc.).  
Each release includes:  
- Consolidated archive (`UXHuman-vX.X-docs.zip`)  
- Corresponding SHA-256 checksums and optional OpenTimestamp proofs (`.ots`)  
- Verified records stored in `/proof/<version>/`

This ensures verifiable provenance and continuity across revisions.

## **Contribution Model**
UXHuman follows an **open-stewardship model.**  
Participation is encouraged through documentation reviews, translations, and RFC proposals aligned with the Governance Framework.  
Submissions are evaluated based on clarity, consistency with the Manifesto, and measurable impact on framework evolution.

---

## **Stewardship**
The **UXHuman Initiative** is currently stewarded by **Smart Goldfish SAS**, based in Sophia Antipolis, France.  
Smart Goldfish contributes the initial research, architecture, and reference implementations that support the IntentWeb ecosystem, including **IntentSite** and **IntentLayer.**

Stewardship is designed to transition to a **foundation structure** as adoption expands, ensuring neutrality and alignment with UXHuman’s four core values: **Language, Trust, Mental Load, and Sovereignty.**

---

## **Summary**
**UXHuman defines the human interface of the IntentWeb — open, interpretable, and aligned with Human Intent rather than attention.**  
It transforms the Web from a system of clicks into a system of comprehension and execution —  
a Web that finally speaks Human.
